# Lab 04 - Implement Virtual Networking

## Lab introduction

This lab is the first of three labs that focuses on virtual networking. In this lab, you learn the basics of virtual networking and subnetting. You learn how to protect your network with network security groups and application security groups. You also learn about DNS zones and records. 

This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the region, but the steps are written using **East US**.

## Estimated time: 50 minutes

## Lab scenario 

Your global organization plans to implement virtual networks. The immediate goal is to accommodate all the existing resources. However, the organization is in a growth phase and wants to ensure there is additional capacity for the growth.

The **CoreServicesVnet** virtual network has the largest number of resources. A large amount of growth is anticipated, so a large address space is necessary for this virtual network.

The **ManufacturingVnet** virtual network contains systems for the operations of the manufacturing facilities. The organization is anticipating a large number of internal connected devices for their systems to retrieve data from. 

## Interactive lab simulations

There are several interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required.

These virtual networks and subnets are structured in a way that accommodates existing resources yet allows for the projected growth. Let's create these virtual networks and subnets to lay the foundation for our networking infrastructure.

>**Did you know?**: It is a good practice to avoid overlapping IP address ranges to reduce issues and simplify troubleshooting. Overlapping is a concern across the entire network, whether in the cloud or on-premises. Many organizations design an enterprise-wide IP addressing scheme to avoid overlapping and plan for future growth.

    | Action | **Deny** |
    | Priority | **4096** |
    | Name | **DenyAnyCustom8080Outbound** |


## Task 4: Configure public and private Azure DNS zones

In this task, you will create and configure public and private DNS zones. 

### Configure a public DNS zone

You can configure Azure DNS to resolve host names in your public domain. For example, if you purchased the contoso.xyz domain name from a domain name registrar, you can configure Azure DNS to host the `contoso.com` domain and resolve www.contoso.xyz to the IP address of your web server or web app.

1. In the portal, search for and select `DNS zones`.

1. Select **+ Create**.

1. Configure the **Basics** tab.

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Subscription | **Select your subscription** |
    | Resource group | **az-104-rg4** |
    | Name | `contoso.com` (if reserved adjust the name) |
    | Region |**East US** (review the informational icon) |

1. Select **Review create** and then **Create**.
   
1. Wait for the DNS zone to deploy and then select **Go to resource**.

1. On the **Overview** blade notice the names of the four Azure DNS name servers assigned to the zone. **Copy** one of the name server addresses. You will need it in a future step. 
  
1. Select **+ Record set**. You add a virtual network link record for each virtual network that needs private name-resolution support.

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Name | **www** |
    | Type | **A** |
    | TTL | **1** |
    | IP address | **10.1.1.4** |

>**Note:**  In a real-world scenario, you'd enter the public IP address of your web server.

1. Select **OK** and verify **contoso.com** has an A record set named **www**.

1. Open a command prompt, and run the following command:

   ```sh
   nslookup www.contoso.com <name server name>
   ```
1. Verify the host name www.contoso.com resolves to the IP address you provided. This confirms name resolution is working correctly.

### Configure a private DNS zone

A private DNS zone provides name resolution services within virtual networks. A private DNS zone is only accessible from the virtual networks that it is linked to and can't be accessed from the internet. 

1. In the portal, search for and select `Private dns zones`.

1. Select **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of Create private DNS zone, enter the information as listed in the table below:

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Subscription | **Select your subscription** |
    | Resource group | **az-104-rg4** |
    | Name | `private.contoso.com` (adjust if you had to rename) |
    | Region |**East US** |

1. Select **Review create** and then **Create**.
   
1. Wait for the DNS zone to deploy and then select **Go to resource**.

1. Notice on the **Overview** blade there are no name server records. 

1. Select **Settings** and then **DNS Management**.

1. Select **Virtual network links** and configure the link. 

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Link name | `manufacturing-link` |
    | Virtual network | `ManufacturingVnet` |

1. Select **Create** and wait for the link to create. 

1. From the **Overview** blade select **+ Record set**. You would now add a record for each virtual machine that needs private name-resolution support.

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Name | **sensorvm** |
    | Type | **A** |
    | TTL | **1** |
    | IP address | **10.1.1.4** |

 >**Note:**  In a real-world scenario, you'd enter the IP address for a specific manufacturing virtual machine.

## Cleanup your resources

If you are working with **your own subscription** take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. 

+ In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select **Delete the resource group**, **Enter resource group name**, and then click **Delete**.
+ Using Azure PowerShell, `Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName`.
+ Using the CLI, `az group delete --name resourceGroupName`.

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 

+ A virtual network is a representation of your own network in the cloud. 
+ When designing virtual networks it is a good practice to avoid overlapping IP address ranges. This will reduce issues and simplify troubleshooting.
+ A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security.
+ A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny network traffic. There are default incoming and outgoing rules which you can customize to your needs.
+ Application security groups are used to protect groups of servers with a common function, such as web servers or database servers.
+ Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution. You can configure Azure DNS to resolve host names in your public domain.  You can also use private DNS zones to assign DNS names to virtual machines (VMs) in your Azure virtual networks.
