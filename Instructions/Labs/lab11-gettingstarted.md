# AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator Workshop

Welcome to your AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Lab 11 - Implement Monitoring

### Overall Estimated Duration: 45 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you explore Azure's monitoring capabilities to gain insights into the performance and configuration of Azure resources, particularly virtual machines. By leveraging Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, you set up and validate alerts, notifications, and log queries to monitor and respond to resource changes effectively. The hands-on tasks include provisioning an infrastructure using a template, configuring and triggering alerts, creating action group notifications, setting up alert processing rules, and executing log queries to analyze data from monitored resources. This lab equips you with essential skills for proactive monitoring and incident response within Azure environments.

## Objective

In this lab, you will explore various Azure Monitor capabilities to enhance the visibility, monitoring, and management of Azure resources, particularly virtual machines.

1. **Provision Infrastructure Using Templates**: Learn to deploy and configure virtual machines and associated resources using custom Azure Resource Manager templates for monitoring purposes.

2. **Implement Alerting Mechanisms**: Configure and validate Azure Monitor alerts to detect critical resource events, such as virtual machine deletions, ensuring timely issue identification.

3. **Set Up Notifications and Processing Rules**: Create action groups to notify stakeholders via email or other channels and implement alert processing rules to manage alert behavior during specific scenarios like maintenance periods.

4. **Analyze Resource Metrics and Logs**: Use Azure Monitor log queries to gather insights into resource performance, including virtual machine utilization and activity trends, for better decision-making.

## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of Azure Monitor and its functionalities for monitoring and alerting.

## Architecture  

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning Using Templates**: You will use custom templates to deploy infrastructure resources such as virtual machines and networks in Azure, simplifying the process of replicating and scaling resources.

2. **Azure Monitor and VM Insights**: Azure Monitor is a central platform for monitoring the performance and health of Azure resources. You will configure VM Insights to gather detailed metrics and logs from virtual machines for monitoring purposes.

3. **Alerts and Action Groups**: You will create and configure alerts in Azure to monitor specific events (e.g., deletion of a virtual machine). Action groups are used to trigger notifications (email, SMS, etc.) when these alerts are activated.

4. **Log Queries and Data Analysis**: Azure Monitor enables querying collected log data using Kusto Query Language (KQL). In this lab, you will create custom queries to analyze virtual machine metrics such as CPU usage, providing insights into system performance.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Custom Template for Infrastructure Provisioning**:  A custom template in Azure is a pre-defined configuration written in JSON format that automates the creation and deployment of Azure resources, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage. 

2. **Azure Monitor and VM Insights**: Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring service in Azure that helps track the performance and health of resources

3. **Alert Creation and Configuration**: Azure alerts are automated notifications triggered based on specific conditions or thresholds defined within the Azure environment.

4. **Log Query and Data Analysis**: Azure Monitor’s log query feature allows users to query and analyze log data generated by Azure resources.
