# Lab 04 - Implement Virtual Networking
## Lab scenario
You need to explore Azure virtual networking capabilities. To start, you plan to create a virtual network in Azure that will host a couple of Azure virtual machines. Since you intend to implement network-based segmentation, you will deploy them into different subnets of the virtual network. You also want to make sure that their private and public IP addresses will not change over time. To comply with Contoso security requirements, you need to protect public endpoints of Azure virtual machines accessible from the Internet. Finally, you need to implement DNS name resolution for Azure virtual machines both within the virtual network and from the Internet.

## Objectives
In this lab, you will:
+ Task 1: Create and configure a virtual network
+ Task 2: Deploy virtual machines into the virtual network
+ Task 3: Configure private and public IP addresses of Azure VMs
+ Task 4: Configure network security groups
+ Task 5: Configure Azure DNS for internal name resolution
+ Task 6: Configure Azure DNS for external name resolution
