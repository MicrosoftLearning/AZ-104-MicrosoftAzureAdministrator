# Contributing to Microsoft Learning Repositories

MCT contributions are a key part of keeping the lab and demo content current as the Azure platform changes. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute changes to the lab files. Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind as you contribute changes.

## GitHub Use & Purpose

Microsoft Learning is using GitHub to publish the lab steps and lab scripts for courses that cover cloud services like Azure. Using GitHub allows the course’s authors and MCTs to keep the lab content current with Azure platform changes. Using GitHub allows the MCTs to provide feedback and suggestions for lab changes, and then the course authors can update lab steps and scripts quickly and relatively easily.

> When you prepare to teach these courses, you should ensure that you are using the latest lab steps and scripts by downloading the appropriate files from GitHub. GitHub should not be used to discuss technical content in the course, or how to prep. It should only be used to address changes in the labs.

It is strongly recommended that MCTs and Partners access these materials and in turn, provide them separately to students.  Pointing students directly to GitHub to access Lab steps as part of an ongoing class will require them to access yet another UI as part of the course, contributing to a confusing experience for the student. An explanation to the student regarding why they are receiving separate Lab instructions can highlight the nature of an always-changing cloud-based interface and platform. Microsoft Learning support for accessing files on GitHub and support for navigation of the GitHub site is limited to MCTs teaching this course only.

> As an alternative to pointing students directly to the GitHub repository, you can point students to the GitHub Pages website to view the lab instructions. The URL for the GitHub Pages website can be found at the top of the repository.

To address general comments about the course and demos, or how to prepare for a course delivery, please use the existing MCT forums.

## Additional Resources

A user guide has been provided for MCTs who are new to GitHub. It provides steps for connecting to GitHub, downloading and printing course materials, updating the scripts that students use in labs, and explaining how you can help ensure that this course’s content remains current.
